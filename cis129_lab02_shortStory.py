print('In the heart of a bustling city, a weary traveler stumbled upon an ancient bookstore tucked away in a forgotten alley. Inside, amidst towering shelves of leather-bound tomes, they discovered a mysterious book with no title. As they flipped through its pages, the words seemed to come alive, whisking them away to a realm of magic and adventure. With each turn, the traveler became entangled in a quest to unlock the secrets of the enchanted book and save a kingdom on the brink of darkness. Through trials and tribulations, they discovered the true power of imagination and the boundless possibilities within the pages of a story.')
